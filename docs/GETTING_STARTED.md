# 🚀 Getting Started with Polymarket Copy Trading Bot

Welcome! This guide will help you set up your copy trading bot in **10 minutes or less**.

## What This Bot Does

Automatically copies trades from successful Polymarket traders to your wallet. Think of it as "follow the experts" for prediction markets.

When a trader you're following makes a bet, the bot:
1. Detects it within 1 second
2. Calculates your proportional position size
3. Places the same bet for you automatically
4. Tracks your performance

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [ ] **Computer with Node.js v18+** ([Download here](https://nodejs.org))
- [ ] **Polygon wallet** (MetaMask or any Web3 wallet)
- [ ] **USDC on Polygon network** (your trading capital)
- [ ] **POL (MATIC)** (~$5-10 for gas fees)
- [ ] **MongoDB database** (free tier available)
- [ ] **RPC endpoint** (free from Infura/Alchemy)

**Don't have these yet?** No worries! See [Detailed Setup](#detailed-setup) below.

## Detailed Setup

### 1. Get a Polygon Wallet

**If you don't have one:**
1. Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)
2. Create a new wallet
3. **Important:** Create a DEDICATED wallet just for the bot (don't use your main wallet!)
4. Save your:
   - Wallet address (starts with 0x...)
   - Private key (Settings → Security & Privacy → Show Private Key)

### 2. Fund Your Wallet

You need two things in your Polygon wallet:

#### A) USDC (Trading Capital)

**Option 1: Bridge from Ethereum**
- Visit [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/deposit)
- Connect wallet and bridge USDC to Polygon
- Takes ~10 minutes

**Option 2: Buy on Exchange**
- Buy USDC on Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc.
- Withdraw to your wallet **on Polygon network**
- Make sure to select "Polygon" not "Ethereum"!

#### B) POL/MATIC (Gas Fees)

- Get $5-10 worth from any exchange
- Withdraw to your wallet on Polygon network
- This pays for transaction fees

### 3. Get MongoDB Database (Free)

1. Visit [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Click "Build a Database" → Choose **FREE** tier
4. Select a region close to you
5. Click "Create Cluster" (takes ~5 minutes)

**Configure Access:**
1. Click "Database Access" → Add New User
   - Username: `botuser` (or anything you want)
   - Password: Generate a strong password
   - User Privileges: "Read and write to any database"
   - Click "Add User"

2. Click "Network Access" → Add IP Address
   - Click "Allow Access from Anywhere"
   - IP: `0.0.0.0/0`
   - Click "Confirm"

**Get Connection String:**
1. Click "Database" → "Connect"
2. Choose "Connect your application"
3. Copy the connection string
4. Replace `<password>` with your actual password
5. Replace `myFirstDatabase` with `polymarket`

Example: `mongodb+srv://myusername676:mypassword676@cluster0.qzpwa2p.mongodb.net/?appName=Cluster0`

### 4. Get RPC Endpoint (Free)

**Option A: Infura (Recommended)**
1. Visit [Infura.io](https://infura.io)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create new project
4. Select "Polygon PoS"
5. Copy the HTTPS endpoint

Example: `https://polygon-mainnet.infura.io/v3/d11c16c6dd2c45a786ecd9f8877daec4`

**Option B: Alchemy**
1. Visit [Alchemy.com](https://www.alchemy.com)
2. Sign up and create app
3. Select "Polygon" network
4. Copy the HTTPS URL

### 5. Find Traders to Copy

Visit the [Polymarket Leaderboard](https://polymarket.com/leaderboard) and look for traders with:

✅ **Good characteristics:**
- Positive total profit (green numbers)
- Win rate above 55%
- Active trading (traded in last 7 days)
- Consistent history (not just one lucky bet)

❌ **Red flags to avoid:**
- Single big win with no other trades
- Win rate below 50%
- Inactive for weeks
- Massive position sizes you can't afford to copy

**How to get their address:**
1. Click on a trader's profile
2. Copy their wallet address from the URL
3. Example: `https://polymarket.com/profile/0x7c3db723f1d4d8cb9c550095203b686cb11e5c6b`
4. The address is: `0x7c3db723f1d4d8cb9c550095203b686cb11e5c6b`

## Safety Tips

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT - Read This First!

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with $500-1000 to test
   - Verify the bot works correctly
   - Scale up gradually

2. **Diversify**
   - Copy 3-5 different traders
   - Don't put all eggs in one basket
   - Mix different trading styles

3. **Monitor Daily**
   - Check bot logs at least once per day
   - Verify trades are executing correctly
   - Watch for errors or issues

4. **Understand the Risks**
   - You can lose ALL your trading capital
   - Past performance ≠ future results
   - No built-in stop-loss
   - Only invest what you can afford to lose

### Emergency Stop

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the bot immediately. It will gracefully shut down and close all connections.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot won't start

**Error: "USER_ADDRESSES is not defined"**
- Run `npm run setup` to create your .env file
- Or manually create .env with all required variables

**Error: "MongoDB connection failed"**
- Check MONGO_URI is correct
- Verify IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas
- Test connection in MongoDB Compass

### No trades detected

- Check traders are active (visit their Polymarket profile)
- Verify USER_ADDRESSES are correct
- Look for errors in bot logs

### Trades failing

**"Insufficient balance"**
- Add USDC to your wallet
- Get POL for gas fees

**"Price slippage too high"**
- Market moved too fast
- Increase FETCH_INTERVAL from 1 to 2-3 seconds
