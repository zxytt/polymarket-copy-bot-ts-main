# Polymarket Copy Trading Bot

> Automated copy trading bot for Polymarket that mirrors trades from top performers with intelligent position sizing and real-time execution. Version 2.0 employs the fastest transaction detection method, enabling near-instantaneous trade replication with lower latency and reduced API load. The copy trading feature in Version 2.0 delivers outstanding performance and resolves all issues previously encountered with “Cloudflare” and VPNs in older versions.


## Overview

The Polymarket Copy Trading Bot automatically replicates trades from successful Polymarket traders to your wallet. It monitors trader activity 24/7, calculates proportional position sizes based on your capital, and executes matching orders in real-time.

### How It Works

![](asset/howitworks.png)

1. **Select Traders** - Choose top performers from [Polymarket leaderboard](https://polymarket.com/leaderboard) or [Predictfolio](https://predictfolio.com)
2. **Monitor Activity** - Bot continuously watches for new positions opened by selected traders using Polymarket Data API
3. **Calculate Size** - Automatically scales trades based on your balance vs. trader's balance
4. **Execute Orders** - Places matching orders on Polymarket using your wallet
5. **Track Performance** - Maintains complete trade history in MongoDB

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) v18+
- MongoDB database ([MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) free tier works)
- Polygon wallet with USDC and POL/MATIC for gas
- RPC endpoint ([Infura](https://infura.io) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com) free tier)

### Installation

#### Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JonathanSharpes/polymarket-copy-bot-ts

cd polymarket-copy-bot-ts
```

#### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

##### Configure Environment
```bash
# Copy the example config
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your settings:

```bash
# Traders to copy (find addresses on Polymarket leaderboard)
USER_ADDRESSES = '0x6a72f61820b26b1fe4d956e17b6dc2a1ea3033ee'

# Your trading wallet (the wallet that will execute trades)
PROXY_WALLET = 'your_polygon_wallet_address'
PRIVATE_KEY = 'your_private_key_without_0x_prefix'

# MongoDB (get free database at mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
# The default link in your .env file is currently functional, but it is recommended that you replace it with your own.
MONGO_URI = 'mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database'

# Polygon RPC (get free key at infura.io or alchemy.com)
# The default link in your .env file is currently functional, but it is recommended that you replace it with your own.
RPC_URL = 'https://polygon-mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
